Updated: August 2020

## Board Diversity

We aim to ensure that the board of trustees represents the diversity of the membership. This includes maintaining a representative balance of gender, artforms, race and socio-economic backgrounds.

## What are the responsibilities of the board?

- Ensuring **regular dialogue with membership** is carried out in order to act in the best interests of members and with their guidance and support.
- Furthering the charity’s overall purpose, as set out in its governing document, and setting its **direction and strategy** – for example, by developing plans and strategies and monitoring progress.
- Ensuring the work of the charity is **effective, responsible and legal** – for example, by the use of policies and procedures and systems for monitoring and evaluating the charity’s work.
- **Safeguarding finances, resources and property** and ensuring they are used to further the charity’s purposes – for example, by insuring and documenting assets, maintaining financial systems, monitoring income and expenditure and ensuring the charity is financially sustainable or viable.
- **Being ‘accountable’** to those with an interest or stake in or who regulate the charity – for example, by preparing annual reports and accounts and consulting with stakeholders. (link to risk?)
- **Being clear** about the people who carry out work on behalf of the charity – trustees, staff, volunteers –establishing and respecting boundaries between the governance role of the board and operational or day to day matters. <added - the board currently undertakes many operational duties and responsibilities - this is an area where further discussion is needed>
- Ensuring the **board operates effectively** – for example, ensuring it receives the right reports and advice, by planning the recruitment and induction of trustees, providing trustees with support and training or carrying out reviews or appraisals of the board’s effectiveness.

# Code of Conduct for Trustees

**Selflessness:** Trustees of Vault Artists Studios have a general duty to act in the best interest of the organisation and its membership as a whole. They should not do so in order to gain financial or material benefits for themselves, their family, their friends or the organisation they come from or represent if they are appointed from outside of VAS membership.

**Integrity:** Trustees of Vault Artists Studios should not place themselves under any financial or other obligation to outside individuals or organisations that might seek to influence them in the performance of their role. As well as avoiding actual impropriety, they should avoid any appearance of improper behaviour or accepting gifts and hospitality that might reasonably be thought to influence their judgement.

**Accountability:** Trustees of Vault Artist Studios have a duty to comply with the law on all occasions in accordance with the trust placed in them and in such a way as to preserve public confidence in the organisation. They are accountable for their decisions and actions to the members, public and funders. They must submit themselves to what scrutiny is appropriate to their role (e.g. declare conflicts of interest to the register).

**Honesty:** Trustees of Vault Artist Studios have a duty to declare any interests relating to their trustee role and to take steps to resolve any conflicts that may arise, and where private interests of a trustee conflicts with their trustee duties, they must resolve this conflict in favour of the trustee role. They must make relevant declarations of interest in the different circumstances and roles they play both within and outside the organisation.

**Leadership:** Trustees of Vault Artist Studios should promote and support the principles of leadership by example. They must respect the role of the Building Manager. There will be circumstances under which trustees will be working directly with paid staff and paid members (e.g. VAS events). Guidelines for such working relationships must be clear to both staff and trustees and, when these occasions arise, the Building Manager / Chair should be informed in advance.

**Conflicts of interest:** Any trustee of Vault Artist Studios who has a financial interest in a matter under discussion should declare the nature of their interest and withdraw from the room unless they have a dispensation to speak. If a trustee has any interest in the matter under discussion which creates a real danger of bias (that is, the interest affects them or a member of their household more than others affected by the decision) they should declare the nature of the interest and withdraw from the room, unless they have a dispensation to speak. If a trustee has any other interest which does not create a real danger of bias, but which might reasonably cause others to think it could influence their decision, they should declare the nature of the interest, but may remain in the room / call, participate in the decision, and vote if they wish. If in any doubt about the application of these rules, they should consult with the Chair. Each trustee’s interests should be recorded in a written statement and listed in a register.
