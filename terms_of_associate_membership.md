# Terms of Associate Membership

## Introduction

Vault Artist Studios was established to breathe life into unused spaces by turning them into artist studios. Over time however what has evolved is much more than that, a vibrant, radical and exciting community. Our 100+ existing members all have their own studio spaces but we have received multiple requests from artists and associates of the Vault to consider an associate membership for people who wish to be part of our community without a studio space.

It is envisaged that these Associate Members will be able to avail themselves of members benefits like use of the membership room, community events, use of communal space and generally just being part of the Vault journey.

## Charitable Purpose

The Charity’s objects (“Objects”) are to:-

(1) Promote arts and creativity to the general public in the Greater Belfast area and its environs (the “area of benefit”) by:

 (a) establishing and maintaining one or more Arts Centres that will provide affordable studio, office and work space for artists and craftspeople on terms appropriate to their means, enabling direct engagement with other artists, craftspeople and the public in a studio or workspace setting;

(b) promoting, organising and delivering events which improve public access to, and participation in, arts and crafts;

(c) organising workshops and seminars and enabling the use of facilities by community groups and organisations;

(d) encouraging interest in, raising awareness of and fostering the development of creative/experimental projects;

(e) encouraging and fostering a view of the arts as a medium of information, expression and advancement.

(2) Promote community development and the regeneration of local areas by occupying formerly empty premises/buildings and, where appropriate, preserving, maintaining and improving such facilities.
