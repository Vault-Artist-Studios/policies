## What is GitHub?

Github is similar to other file storage and synchronisation services like Dropbox or Google Drive, except if has a concept called 'commits'

These commits are fixed static 'versions' of files.

Using these commits, we can do things like comparing different versions of files together in the same place, rather than being 'stuck' in one version of one file at a time. 

We can also make suggested changes across multiple files at once, without having to change the 'official' versions of policies. That way we can have constructive conversations about how policies interact and are implemented without thought.

## What is Markdown

> Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents
>
> Using Markdown is different than using a [WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to  format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately.  Markdown isn’t like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases  should look different.
>
> For instance, to denote a heading, you add a number sign before it (e.g., `# Heading One`). Or to make a phrase bold, you add two asterisks before and after it (e.g., `**this text is bold**`). It may take a while to get used to seeing Markdown syntax in your text, especially if you’re accustomed to WYSIWYG applications.
