## 2.  Code of conduct and behaviour

We follow strict recruitment practices to ensure skilled and experienced practitioners leading our sessions are safe and put the welfare of our participants first. We undertake AccessNI checks on all paid staff and regular volunteers. All activities involving children and vulnerable adults should be managed according to this code of conduct, with full risk assessments and risk management as standard.

Management arrangements should be designed to avoid this situation and all staff carry a responsibility for vigilance in this regard, other than in the case of an emergency 
- Staff should provide an atmosphere that is conducive to positive experiences for our patrons and participants 

2.8  There are times when Vault Artist Studios members may bring children, young people and vulnerable adults onto the premises as their guests.

## 3.  Information for visiting groups

3.1  Vault Artist Studios operates a Safeguarding Policy committing it to making sure children are protected and kept safe from harm while they are with the company. Vault Artist Studios is also committed to ensuring that the rights of children, young people and adults at risk are respected and understood by its employees, including freelance artists, and volunteers. 

As an organisation interested in or booked for a Vault Artist Studios activity, the following outlines some additional information that relates specifically to Child Protection over and above practical arrangements for your visit. 

3.2  What we expect from you 

Vault Artist Studios expects that most organisations will have a formal Child Protection Policy and Procedures. If you do not, we would encourage you to seek advice about developing a policy. Vault Artist Studios will ask for a named contact and Child Protection Officer. These might not be the same people but we would ask you to consider the time of day or the date when you visit us (i.e. at least one of these people should be there when we are). 

We will also ask about the number of children/young people and the number of adults who will be there. It is your responsibility to provide adequate supervision for your group for the full duration of the activity. Under no circumstances should a Vault Artist Studios member of staff be left alone with the children at any time. If we are unhappy at the level of supervision, inadequate facilities or if we feel our staff are being mistreated or abused, Vault Artist Studios will reserve the right to halt or cancel an activity.

You can be assured that anyone from Vault Artist Studios who visits your organisation has committed themselves to Vault Artist Studios’ Safeguarding Policy. They will be trained professionals who understand how to work with young people and adults at risk and they will show you and your children/adults the respect you deserve. They will also have received our guidelines in recognising signs of abuse, reporting allegations and concerns and receiving disclosures. They will have also undergone an Enhanced Disclosure check by Access NI. 

If at any point, you have a concern about the behaviour of one of our employees, contact Vault Artist Studios’s Designated Safeguarding Lead, Rob Hilken on 07968120508.
