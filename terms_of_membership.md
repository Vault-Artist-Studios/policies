## Membership 

Membership of Vault Artist Studios gives you one vote in matters arising at any annual or extraordinary general meeting. This includes changes to the constitution, appointing or removing the charity trustees, and deciding whether the charity should be wound up. Only studio holders and trustees/directors can be members.

As a member you agree to adhere to these Terms of Membership and a serious breach of these terms will result in the termination of membership.

As a member you are granted permission to use a room as your personal studio workspace. Termination of membership will result in withdrawal of permission to use the building. 

# Membership Fees

Your membership fee will be determined by the size of the room that you occupy. The membership fee is made up of:

- £15 fee per person
- An additional fee of £0.65 per square metre in the room that you will be using
- discounts may be applied where facilities are below average
- discounts may be applied for group usage (ie where groups of people sharing a room result in an unreasonably large cost)

The membership fee covers all costs associated with running the studio, including: electricity, water, internet connectivity, public liability insurance (for common areas), legal fees, administration costs and general maintenance. There will be a review of membership fees every 3 months to ensure that we are covering the costs of running the building.

Unless otherwise agreed by members, no members will receive a fee or discount to studio rents for carrying out tasks related to the running of the building or charity.

Invoices for membership fees are issued by email on the 1st of each month and are payable in advance.

## Participation & Community

We keep the rent as cheap as possible for our members but in return we expect our members to make an active contribution to both our community and the local community.

**We have a monthly meeting for all members, alternating between 12pm on the last Friday, and 6pm on the last Monday of every month. These are mandatory meetings**

- We expect all of our members to contribute towards the running of the studio. This includes (but it not limited to):

- - cleaning communal areas
  - participating in general upkeep of the building
  - volunteering to complete tasks agreed at monthly meetings
  - taking part in management sub-committees
  - playing a role in organising and promoting events

- We expect all of our members to contribute to and participate in various community events throughout the year including:

- - open studios events
  - social and food events
  - performances and exhibition openings

### Respect

We aim to be good members of the local community, who are important stakeholders of the charity. Respecting our neighbours is integral to this and so, where possible, we encourage members to talk to and get to know our neighbours, shop in the local shop and engage in events organised by the local community.

Within our own community, we all need to strive towards cohesion and harmony. Therefore we expect our members to have respect for each other. We must listen and communicate with consideration for our fellow members. Please try to settle disputes amicably and be prepared to listen to the concerns other members might have. Think carefully about your fellow members' privacy, values, opinions and wellbeing.

The trustees will try and mediate disputes should that become necessary.
