# GDPR Policy at Vault Artist Studios

Written: April 2019

Designated GDPR officer: Robin Price, artists@vaultartiststudios.com

## 1.  GDPR policy statement 

Vault Artist Studios take the safety of our members and visitors private digital information seriously. We do not use or trade our members’ / visitors’ mailing list for any marketing related or commercial purposes. In this document we outline what information we collect on our members and visitors, how we use it, the limited conditions when we may disclose it and how we keep that information secure.

## 2.  Types of data we collect

### 2.1  Member information 

To keep in contact with our members we collect our members’ names, addresses, phone numbers. To maintain a diversity of practice within the studio group we collect information on their artistic discipline and to help run the organization we record what subcommittees they would like to participate in. Finally we collect their insurance details, as we require members to individually insure their studio spaces.

### 2.2  Mailing Lists 

As part of our membership policy all members of Vault Artists Studios are required to sign up to our Members mailing list. We use this to send out important information about Vault Events, Building Maintenance and Security, forthcoming meetings, etc. We do not give out our member’s email addresses to any individuals or other organisations. We use a third party provider MailChimp to deliver this and gather statistics on how many people have opened and read it. For more information, please see [MailChimp’s privacy notice](https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/).

### 2.3  Visiting groups with children 

As part of our [Safeguarding children policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AYthiaNkx4mwA2b_AOTzjo836hJnvIjjEgMtW9KkeEI/edit?usp=sharing) when visiting groups are bringing children Vault Artist Studios maintains records of the named contact and Child Protection Officer of each group that visits. We do this to comply with UK law. If the event is photographed then we will keep records of the names and signatures of any consent forms that have been filled out by next of kin. 

### 2.4 Donations and Ticket Sales 

When people use our website’s donate button or use our online ticketing software to buy tickets to Vault events we collect their name, address, email address, and phone number. We do not use this information in anything unconnected with completing that donation or sale and we do not sell or pass that information on to any third party.

We also use third party booking systems such as EventBrite for ticketed events. For more information, please see [EventBrite’s privacy policy](https://www.eventbrite.com/support/articles/en_US/Troubleshooting/eventbrite-privacy-policy?lg=en_US).

### 2.5 Website Cookies

When people visit our website we use Google Analytics to collect and log standard metadata around visitor behavior patterns. We do this to log the number of visitors to the different parts of our site. This information is anonymised and we do not make, nor allow Google to make, any attempt to find out the identities of people visiting our website.

## 3.  Access to your personal information
